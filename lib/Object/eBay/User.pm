    use Object::eBay::User;
    # Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)
 
    # This section will be as far as many users bother reading
    # so make it as educational and exemplary as possible.
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
A full description of the module and its features.
May include numerous subsections (i.e. =head2, =head3, etc.) 
 
 
=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS 
 
A separate section listing the public components of the module's interface. 
These normally consist of either subroutines that may be exported, or methods
that may be called on objects belonging to the classes that the module provides.
Name the section accordingly.
 
In an object-oriented module, this section should begin with a sentence of the 
form "An object of this class represents...", to give the reader a high-level
context to help them understand the methods that are subsequently described.
 
 
=head1 DIAGNOSTICS
 
A list of every error and warning message that the module can generate
(even the ones that will "never happen"), with a full explanation of each 
problem, one or more likely causes, and any suggested remedies.
 
 
=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
 
Object::eBay::User requires no configuration files or environment variables.
 
=head1 DEPENDENCIES
 
A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon, including any
restrictions on versions, and an indication whether these required modules are
part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the module's distribution,
or must be installed separately.
 
 
=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES
 
A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction with.
This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or competition for 
system or program resources, or due to internal limitations of Perl 
(for example, many modules that use source code filters are mutually 
incompatible).
